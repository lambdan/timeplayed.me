      <strong>2025-07-06: Incident</strong>
      <p>
        Due to a series of mishaps, <b>sessions between approximately 2025-07-06 01:00-14:40 (Swedish time) may have been lost</b>. I say may have, because I don't know if anyone actually played anything during that time.
        <br><br>
        This was because I manually added some sessions I had played, but accidentally set the wrong game one entry. So I used the <code>!setgame</code> command to change it, but it turns out that command had a problem where it changed the game for ALL sessions! Yikes...
        <br><br>
        Fortunately, I am backing up the database daily. Unfortunately, it is done on midnight UTC, so the backup containing data for 2025-07-05 had not been done yet, so I had to resort to the backup from the night before.
        <br><br>
        I then extracted the messed up database of 2025-07-05 (which had all the games set to one single game (<i>Serious Sam: Xbox</i> if you are curious)), and <i>manually</i> inserted the sessions of 2025-07-05 into the backup from the day before.
        <br><br>
        Fortunately, I had the most sessions that day, so I knew what games I had played, and I also visit the website frequently so I have a decent idea of what people are playing, so I could make some educated guesses on the others. If I guessed wrong, feel free to change it using the <code>!setgame</code> command, it should work now ðŸ¤ž
        <br>
        Then I went to bed, thinking everything was fine.
        <br><br>
        The next day, while working on preventing stuff like this from happening again (more on that soon), I noticed my test sessions weren't saving. It turns out, because I had manually manipulated some sessions earlier, the sequence numbers in the database was messed up, and so the bot would not insert any new entries because the id's were conflicting. 
        I actually had a similar problem earlier, when I was migrating from v1 of storage to v2, and I fixed that then by resetting the sequences after migration. But I very recently removed this part of the code, because the migration was done so I figured it wasn't needed anymore... 
        Well anyway, the sequence resetting is back now, and everything is fine again.
        <br><br>
        To hopefully prevent something like this happening again, though you should not underestimate my stupidity, I've done a few things:
        <ul>
          <li>The database is now backed up hourly, instead of daily</li>
          <li>I've set up additional logging. This way, if something screws up I can atleast manually go through the logs and recreate what is lost, should there be need to.</li>
        </ul>
        I could keep quiet about this, because most likely no one even noticed this happened, but I want to be transparent about incidents like this to build trust.

      <strong>2025-06-24: Version 2.0.0</strong>
      <p>
        The website has been completely redesigned! It now uses
        <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> and should be much more
        responsive and just nicer to use in general. <br />For example, loading
        the Games page shouldn't take forever anymore, as the cover art is now
        loaded asynchronously.
        <br />
        There is still work to do, particularly with the backend/the bot,
        oblivionis. I have forked it and added an API to it (which is how the
        website gets its data now) which I want to clean up and provide
        documentation for.<br />
        The commands system has also been pretty neglected while I was
        re-working the frontend, so it has a lot of bugs.
        <br />
        But, the website is now decent enough for now. Maybe I will actually
        play some games now!

      <strong>2025-06-10: Incorrect timestamps</strong>
      <p>
        Due to a bug, sessions played between 2025-06-09 21:48 to 2025-06-10
        17:00 (UTC) have incorrectly gotten their timestamps set to
        <code>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 21:48:24 GMT</code>.
        <br />
        Sorry about that.
        <br />
        A command has been added to the bot that lets you modify the date of a
        session, so you can fix it retroactively: <code>!setdate</code> <br /><i
          >-djs</i
        >
      </p>

      <strong>2025-06-09: Platform support</strong>
      <p>
        Platform is now tracked. Website will better designed soon to show it
        better. It's all very WIP right now. You can also do some commands with
        the bot. Write <code>!help</code> to the bot to see what's possible!
