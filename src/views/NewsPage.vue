      <strong>2025-06-10: Incorrect timestamps</strong>
      <p>
        Due to a bug, sessions played between 2025-06-09 21:48 to 2025-06-10
        17:00 (UTC) have incorrectly gotten their timestamps set to
        <code>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 21:48:24 GMT</code>.
        <br />
        Sorry about that.
        <br />
        A command has been added to the bot that lets you modify the date of a
        session, so you can fix it retroactively: <code>!setdate</code>
      </p>

        better. It's all very WIP right now. You can also do some commands with
        the bot. Write <code>!help</code> to the bot to see what's possible!
