      <strong>2025-06-10: Incorrect timestamps</strong>
      <p>Due to a bug, sessions played between 2025-06-09 21:48 to 2025-06-10 17:00 (UTC) have incorrectly gotten their timestamps set to `Mon, 09 Jun 2025 21:48:24 GMT`. Sorry about that. A command has been added to the bot that lets you modify the date of a session, so you can fix it retroactively: <code>!moddate</code></p>
      <strong>2025-06-09: Platform support</strong>
      <p>Platform is now tracked. Website will better designed soon to show it better. It's all very WIP right now. You can also do some commands with the bot. Write <code>!help</code> to the bot to see what's possible!</p>
